#Confounding variables -

#2	DiD with Card and Krueger (1993). Download the dataset and definitions file from the coursework repo. Note: (1) that the first interview occurred before the onset of the minimum wage and that the second occurred after and (2) this dataset is paired (each restaurant has a before and after observation) so the steps you take will be a little bit different than those discussed in class.
#Confounding Variables:  unemployment in 2008, increase in poverty in 2008
#Variance-reducing variables: spike in job opportunities
#Unrelated variables: Weather of year, Astrological sign
#Bad controls: unemployment rate in 2009,

#A(a)	Before looking at the data, look just at the list outcome metrics that were tracked in each interview (EMPFT EMPPT NMGRS WAGEST INCTIME FIRSTINC BONUS PCTAFF MEALS OPEN HRSOPEN PSODA PFRY PENTREE NREGS ). List the ones that you think could be impacted by the minimum wage change and give a brief explanation of why.
#EMPFT, EMPPT, NMGRS- full time employees, part time employees and managers could be impacted by minimum wage because it could affect their income and their level of involvement
#WAGEST- Starting wage would be affected because that would lead to a general increase.
#INCTIME- could possibly be extended
#Bonus- could possibly be increased
#PCTAFF- could be increased
#Meals- could be set by policy
#OPEN- increased
#PSODA, PFRY, PENTREE


#(b)	Compute the 'diffs'. Check to see if each outcome metric changed in a statistically significant way between the two interviews. Do this analysis separately for PA and NJ.

PA<- Card %>% filter(STATE == 1) %>% select(PA1, PA2)
NJ<- Card %>% filter(STATE ==0) %>% select(SOUTHJ, CENTRALJ, NORTHJ)
first_interview <- c("NCALLS", "EMPFT", "EMPPT","NMGRS", "WAGE_ST", "INCTIME","MEALS", "HRSOPEN" ,"PSODA", "PFRY", "PENTREE", "NREGS", "NREGS11")

second_interview <-c("NCALLS2", "EMPFT2", "EMPPT2", "NMGRS2", "WAGE_ST2", "INCTIME2", "MEALS2", "HRSOPEN2","PSODA2", "PFRY2", "PENTREE2", "NREGS2","NREGS112")


nj_data = Card[which(Card['STATE']==1),]
nj_data
  
#(c)	Now compute the "diff-in-diff" via the regression method. As Imentioned previously, this step will be a little different because the data is paired. Think carefully about the best way to do this and I'll come and chat with you guys about it after about an hour.
#(d)	Do you believe this analysis provides definitive evidence on theimpact of the minimum wage on employment? Can you imagine a scenario that would lead to this type of estimation giving biased results?
#(e)	Card and Krueger create an Independent Variable called GAP = (5.05???Wpre)/Wpre, this is the percentage wage increase that New Jersey restaurants needed in order to meet the minimum wage. Use the variable WAGEST (from before the interview) to create this variable. How might restaurants with very large or small values of this variable differ in their response to the minimum wage. Why do you think this variable is interesting? Run any other interesting analysis you can think of using this variable.
