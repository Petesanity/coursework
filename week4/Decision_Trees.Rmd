#8 Even though we don't know the fate of the passengers in the test data set, Kaggle does. In fact, Kaggle will evaluate our predictions and compare the accuracy of our predictions to those of other participants in the competition. All we have to do is register with Kaggle and create a .csv file that contains two columns: PassengerId and Survived. Where Survived contains our predictions 0 for did not survive, and 1 for survived. We can do this by first creating a data frame (let's call it submit) using function data.frame() with the two columns. It should look something like this:submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction) Second, we need to write a .csv file using function write.csv() This function takes a data frame to be written as its first argument, name of .csv file to be created as the second argument. We also need to use option row.names = FALSE to prevent the function from adding an additional column with row numbers. It should look something like this: write.csv(submit, "C:/business analytics/labs/lab 12/Submission.csv", row.names = FALSE) Submit your predictions and report on your accuracy and rank compared to other participants. Take a screenshot and attach to your lab.

submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = titan_test$PassengerId, Survived = pred)

submit

write.csv(submit, "TitanicSubmission.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
